# Generative AI Webpage Editor

## Project Overview

This project is a web application that leverages generative AI to create and edit webpages dynamically. It allows users to describe a webpage in natural language, generate the corresponding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then interactively edit specific elements of the page.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Webpage Generation**: Users can input a description of their desired webpage, and the application uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate the appropriate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Interactive Editing**: Users can select specific elements on the generated webpage and provide instructions for modifications. The AI then updates the selected element based on these instructions.
- **Real-time Preview**: The application provides a real-time preview of the generated and edited webpage.
- **Export Functionality**: Users can export their created webpage as an HTML file, which includes all necessary styles and scripts.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python with Flask framework
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model

## How It Works

1. The user enters a description of the desired webpage.
2. The backend sends this description to the OpenAI API, which generates the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. The generated code is displayed in the browser and stored in a server-side cache.
4. Users can then select elements of the webpage for editing.
5. Edit instructions are sent to the AI, which modifies the selected element and updates the entire webpage.
6. At any point, users can export the current version of the webpage as an HTML file.

## Potential Use Cases

- Rapid prototyping of web designs
- Educational tool for web development
- Assisting non-technical users in creating simple webpages
- Experimenting with AI-generated web content and designs

## Future Enhancements

- Implement user authentication and persistent storage of projects
- Enhance the UI/UX of the interface
- Expand AI capabilities to handle more complex web applications and interactive elements
